# Introduction

Adaptive trial designs enable planned modifications to ongoing studies based on accumulating data while preserving statistical validity. **Conditional power** in the frequentist framework provides a classical approach to evaluate the probability of trial success given interim data and fixed assumptions about treatment effects, guiding decisions on early stopping or sample size re-estimation.

This tutorial demonstrates the theoretical foundation and practical implementation of frequentist conditional power through the VALOR trial case study, specifically focusing on **sample size re-estimation** when interim data suggest the original design assumptions may require adjustment.

# 2. Methodology

## 2.1 Frequentist Conditional Power Framework

### Definition
Frequentist conditional power calculates the probability that a trial will ultimately demonstrate statistical significance, given the observed interim data and a **fixed assumption** about the true treatment effect.

Mathematically, conditional power at interim analysis is:
$$CP(\theta) = P(\text{Reject } H_0 \text{ at final analysis} \mid \text{Interim data } D_1, \theta)$$

where $\theta$ represents a **fixed, unknown parameter** rather than a random variable.

### Key Philosophical Distinction
Unlike Bayesian approaches that treat the treatment effect as a random variable with a posterior distribution, the frequentist framework:

- **Treats $\theta$ as fixed but unknown**
- **Requires explicit specification** of the treatment effect assumption
- **Provides conditional probability statements** given specific parameter values
- **Does not formally incorporate prior information**

## 2.2 Frequentist Conditional Power Approaches

### Approach 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
Use the observed treatment effect from interim data as the assumed true effect:
$$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \hat{\theta}_1$$

**Advantages**: Data-driven, reflects current evidence
**Disadvantages**: May be overly optimistic due to interim variability

### Approach 2: Conservative Lower Bound
Use the lower confidence limit of the interim treatment effect:
$$\hat{\theta}_{conservative} = \hat{\theta}_1 - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE_1$$

**Advantages**: Accounts for uncertainty in interim estimate
**Disadvantages**: May be overly pessimistic

### Approach 3: Design Assumption
Use the original planning assumption, independent of interim data:
$$\theta_{design} = \theta_{planned}$$

**Advantages**: Consistent with original power calculation
**Disadvantages**: Ignores interim evidence

### Approach 4: Minimum Clinically Relevant Effect
Use the smallest effect size considered clinically meaningful:
$$\theta_{min} = \text{minimum worthwhile effect}$$

**Advantages**: Ensures power for meaningful effects
**Disadvantages**: May be too conservative

## 2.3 Mathematical Formulation

### Test Statistic Distribution
For survival trials with information-based design, the final test statistic follows:
$$Z_{final} = \frac{\hat{\theta}_{final}}{\text{SE}_{final}} \sim N\left(\frac{\theta}{\text{SE}_{final}}, 1\right)$$

With total information $I_{total} = n_{total}$ events:
$$Z_{final} \sim N(\theta\sqrt{n_{total}}, 1)$$

### Conditional Power Formula
For a two-sided test with significance level $\alpha$:
$$CP(\theta) = P(|Z_{final}| > z_{\alpha/2} \mid D_1, \theta)$$

$$= \Phi\left(\frac{\theta\sqrt{n_{total}} - z_{\alpha/2}}{1}\right) + \Phi\left(\frac{-\theta\sqrt{n_{total}} - z_{\alpha/2}}{1}\right)$$

For one-sided alternative (more common in practice):
$$CP(\theta) = \Phi(\theta\sqrt{n_{total}} - z_{\alpha})$$

### Information Fraction Adjustment
When interim analysis uses partial information:
$$I_1 = n_{interim}, \quad I_{total} = n_{interim} + n_{remaining}$$

The conditional power becomes:
$$CP(\theta) = \Phi\left(\theta\sqrt{n_{total}} - z_{\alpha}\right)$$

where the observed interim data provides the evidence for choosing $\theta$.

## 2.4 Sample Size Re-estimation Framework

### Decision Thresholds
Define operational boundaries:
- **Efficacy threshold** $\gamma_1$: Stop for efficacy if $CP(\theta) > \gamma_1$
- **Futility threshold** $\gamma_2$: Stop for futility if $CP(\theta) < \gamma_2$ 
- **Re-estimation zone**: $\gamma_2 \leq CP(\theta) \leq \gamma_1$

### Re-estimation Procedure
When conditional power falls in the re-estimation zone:

1. **Select effect assumption**: Choose $\theta$ based on one of the approaches in Section 2.2
2. **Calculate required sample size**: Find $n_{new}$ such that:
   $$CP(\theta, n_{new}) = \Phi(\theta\sqrt{n_{new}} - z_{\alpha}) \geq CP_{target}$$
3. **Solve for $n_{new}$**:
   $$n_{new} = \left(\frac{\Phi^{-1}(CP_{target}) + z_{\alpha}}{\theta}\right)^2$$
4. **Check feasibility**: Ensure $n_{new} \leq n_{max}$
5. **Implement decision**: Continue with original or modified sample size

### Type I Error Control
Frequentist conditional power naturally preserves Type I error rate when:
- **Pre-specification**: All adaptation rules specified before trial start
- **Unchanged hypotheses**: Primary endpoints and significance levels remain fixed
- **Information-based design**: Sample size modifications based on event counts, not effect estimates

The key insight is that **conditional power calculations do not use the test statistic** for the final hypothesis test, avoiding inflation of Type I error.

## 2.5 Comparative Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- **Computational simplicity**: Direct analytical formulas
- **Regulatory acceptance**: Well-established precedent
- **Transparent assumptions**: Explicit effect size specifications
- **Objective interpretation**: No subjective prior specification required

### Limitations
- **Single-point estimates**: No natural uncertainty quantification
- **Assumption dependency**: Results highly sensitive to chosen $\theta$
- **Prior information**: Cannot formally incorporate historical data
- **Conservative nature**: Often requires sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios

# 3. Case Study: VALOR Trial

## 3.1 Trial Overview

We demonstrate frequentist conditional power methodology using the same VALOR trial design for direct comparison with Bayesian approaches:

- **Study**: Phase III trial in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia
- **Treatment**: Vosaroxin + Cytarabine vs Placebo + Cytarabine  
- **Primary Endpoint**: Overall survival time (log hazard ratio $\theta$)
- **Original Design**: 375 events needed for 90% power at HR = 0.75
- **Interim Analysis**: After 173 events (46% of target events)
- **Maximum Events**: 562 (50% increase allowed)
- **Decision Thresholds**: $\gamma_1 = 0.80$, $\gamma_2 = 0.20$

> **Case Study Focus**: This tutorial demonstrates **frequentist sample size re-estimation** when interim data suggest different treatment effects than originally assumed, requiring conditional power calculations under multiple effect size scenarios.

## 3.2 Implementation Steps

The case study follows these systematic steps:

1. **Step 1**: Specify trial design parameters and effect size assumptions
2. **Step 2**: Simulate interim data $D_1$ at 173 events  
3. **Step 3**: Calculate interim treatment effect estimates
4. **Step 4**: Compute conditional power under different effect assumptions
5. **Step 5**: Apply decision rules and perform sample size re-estimation
6. **Step 6**: Sensitivity analysis and comparison across approaches

library(knitr)
library(gridExtra)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
```

# 4. Step 1: Trial Design and Effect Assumptions

Following the methodology in Section 2, we specify the trial parameters and potential effect size assumptions:

```{r trial-parameters}
# VALOR trial design parameters (identical to Bayesian version for comparison)
target_events_original <- 375      # Events needed for 90% power
interim_events <- 173             # Interim analysis point (46% of target)
max_events <- 562                 # Maximum events after re-estimation (50% increase)
target_power <- 0.90             # Target power (CP_target)
alpha <- 0.05                     # Type I error rate (one-sided: 0.025 each side)

# Original design assumption
assumed_hr_design <- 0.75         # 25% reduction in hazard (planning assumption)
log_hr_design <- log(assumed_hr_design)

# Decision thresholds for conditional power
gamma1 <- 0.80  # Efficacy threshold: stop for success if CP > γ₁
gamma2 <- 0.20  # Futility threshold: stop for futility if CP < γ₂

# Alternative effect size assumptions for frequentist approaches
min_clinically_relevant_hr <- 0.85  # Minimum meaningful effect (15% reduction)
log_hr_min <- log(min_clinically_relevant_hr)

print("=== VALOR TRIAL DESIGN PARAMETERS ===")
print(paste("Original target events:", target_events_original))
print(paste("Interim analysis at:", interim_events, "events"))
print(paste("Maximum events allowed:", max_events))
print(paste("Design assumption HR:", assumed_hr_design))
print(paste("Minimum clinical HR:", min_clinically_relevant_hr))
print(paste("Efficacy threshold (γ₁):", gamma1))
print(paste("Futility threshold (γ₂):", gamma2))
print(paste("Target power:", target_power))
```

## 4.1 Effect Size Assumption Framework

```{r effect-assumptions}
# Create framework for multiple effect size assumptions
effect_assumptions <- data.frame(
  Approach = c("Design Assumption", "Minimum Clinical Effect", "MLE (TBD)", "Conservative (TBD)"),
  Description = c(
    "Original planning assumption (HR = 0.75)",
    "Smallest clinically relevant effect (HR = 0.85)", 
    "Maximum likelihood estimate from interim data",
    "Lower confidence bound of interim estimate"
  ),
  Log_HR = c(log_hr_design, log_hr_min, NA, NA),
  HR = c(assumed_hr_design, min_clinically_relevant_hr, NA, NA),
  Rationale = c(
    "Independent of interim data, consistent with power calculation",
    "Conservative approach ensuring power for meaningful effects",
    "Data-driven approach reflecting current evidence", 
    "Accounts for uncertainty in interim treatment estimate"
  )
)

print("=== FREQUENTIST EFFECT SIZE APPROACHES ===")
kable(effect_assumptions %>% select(Approach, Description, HR, Rationale),
      caption = "Framework for Frequentist Conditional Power Calculations")

cat("\nPhilosophical Framework:\n")
cat("• Frequentist approach requires explicit specification of θ\n")
cat("• Different assumptions lead to different conditional power values\n")
cat("• Sensitivity analysis across assumptions provides robustness assessment\n")
cat("• No single 'correct' assumption - depends on clinical and statistical considerations\n")
```

# 5. Step 2: Interim Data Simulation

We simulate interim data to represent a realistic scenario for sample size re-estimation:

```{r simulate-interim}
# Function to simulate survival data (same as Bayesian version for consistency)
simulate_survival_data <- function(n_control, n_treatment, hr_true, 
                                 median_survival_control = 12) {
  
  # Convert median survival to rate parameter (exponential distribution)
  lambda_control <- log(2) / median_survival_control
  lambda_treatment <- lambda_control * hr_true
  
  # Simulate survival times
  control_times <- rexp(n_control, lambda_control)
  treatment_times <- rexp(n_treatment, lambda_treatment)
  
  # Create dataset
  data.frame(
    time = c(control_times, treatment_times),
    event = rep(1, n_control + n_treatment), # All events observed at interim
    treatment = c(rep(0, n_control), rep(1, n_treatment))
  )
}

# Simulate interim data D₁ (173 events observed)
n_interim <- 200  # Approximate number of patients for 173 events
interim_data <- simulate_survival_data(
  n_control = n_interim/2, 
  n_treatment = n_interim/2, 
  hr_true = 0.85  # True HR showing modest benefit (same scenario as Bayesian version)
)

# Fit Cox proportional hazards model
cox_model <- coxph(Surv(time, event) ~ treatment, data = interim_data)
interim_log_hr <- coef(cox_model)      # θ̂₁ (MLE)
interim_se <- sqrt(vcov(cox_model))    # SE₁

print("=== INTERIM DATA ANALYSIS (D₁) ===")
print(paste("Observed log HR (θ̂₁):", round(interim_log_hr, 3)))
print(paste("Standard error (SE₁):", round(interim_se, 3)))
print(paste("Observed HR:", round(exp(interim_log_hr), 3)))

# Confidence interval for treatment effect
ci_lower_log <- interim_log_hr - 1.96 * interim_se
ci_upper_log <- interim_log_hr + 1.96 * interim_se

print(paste("95% CI (log HR): [", round(ci_lower_log, 3), ",", round(ci_upper_log, 3), "]"))
print(paste("95% CI (HR): [", round(exp(ci_lower_log), 3), ",", round(exp(ci_upper_log), 3), "]"))

# Test statistic and p-value
z_interim <- interim_log_hr / interim_se
p_value_interim <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_interim)))
print(paste("Z-statistic:", round(z_interim, 3)))
print(paste("Two-sided p-value:", round(p_value_interim, 4)))

# Statistical significance at interim
if (p_value_interim < 0.05) {
  print("✓ Statistical significance achieved at interim")
} else {
  print("○ No statistical significance at interim")
}

# Information fraction
info_fraction <- interim_events / target_events_original
print(paste("Information fraction:", round(info_fraction, 3)))
```

# 6. Step 3: Complete Effect Assumption Framework

Now we complete the effect size assumption framework with observed data:

```{r complete-assumptions}
# Complete the effect assumptions with interim data
log_hr_mle <- interim_log_hr  # MLE approach
log_hr_conservative <- ci_lower_log  # Conservative approach (lower CI bound)

# Update the framework
effect_assumptions_complete <- data.frame(
  Approach = c("Design Assumption", "Minimum Clinical", "MLE", "Conservative"),
  Log_HR = c(log_hr_design, log_hr_min, log_hr_mle, log_hr_conservative),
  HR = c(assumed_hr_design, min_clinically_relevant_hr, exp(log_hr_mle), exp(log_hr_conservative)),
  Source = c("Planning phase", "Clinical judgment", "Interim data", "Interim data (lower CI)"),
  Philosophy = c("Data-independent", "Clinically-driven", "Data-driven", "Uncertainty-adjusted")
)

print("=== COMPLETED EFFECT SIZE ASSUMPTIONS ===")
kable(effect_assumptions_complete %>%
      mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 3))),
      caption = "Frequentist Conditional Power: Effect Size Assumptions")

# Visualize the different assumptions
assumption_plot <- effect_assumptions_complete %>%

       y = "Hazard Ratio",
       fill = "Philosophy",
       subtitle = "Blue dotted line: Observed interim HR") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

print(assumption_plot)

cat("\n=== INTERPRETATION OF ASSUMPTIONS ===\n")
cat("Range of assumptions:\n")
cat("• Most optimistic:", round(min(effect_assumptions_complete$HR), 3), "(", 
    effect_assumptions_complete$Approach[which.min(effect_assumptions_complete$HR)], ")\n")
cat("• Most conservative:", round(max(effect_assumptions_complete$HR), 3), "(",

```

# 7. Step 4: Frequentist Conditional Power Calculation

Following Section 2.3, we implement frequentist conditional power calculations:

```{r frequentist-cp-functions}
#| echo: true
# Core frequentist conditional power calculation function
calculate_frequentist_cp <- function(theta_log, events_interim, events_remaining, 
                                   alpha = 0.05, two_sided = TRUE) {
  
  total_events <- events_interim + events_remaining
  
  if (two_sided) {
    # Two-sided test
    critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)

    # Conditional power calculation
    cp <- 1 - pnorm(critical_value - z_final_mean) + pnorm(-critical_value - z_final_mean)
  } else {
    # One-sided test (assuming negative log HR indicates benefit)
    critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha)
    z_final_mean <- theta_log * sqrt(total_events)
    
    # For one-sided test with H1: theta < 0

  return(cp)
}

# Sample size calculation function

                                    events_interim = 0, two_sided = TRUE) {
  
  if (two_sided) {
    critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
    # Solve: target_cp = 1 - Φ(z_α/2 - |θ|√n) + Φ(-z_α/2 - |θ|√n)
    # Approximation for small theta: target_cp ≈ Φ(|θ|√n - z_α/2)
    target_z <- qnorm(target_cp/2) # Rough approximation
    n_required <- ((target_z + critical_value) / abs(theta_log))^2
  } else {
    critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha)
    target_z <- qnorm(target_cp)
    n_required <- ((target_z + critical_value) / abs(theta_log))^2
  }
  
  return(max(events_interim, ceiling(n_required)))
}

# Decision function
make_decision <- function(conditional_power, gamma1, gamma2) {
  if (conditional_power > gamma1) {
    return("STOP for EFFICACY")
  } else if (conditional_power < gamma2) {

# Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated the comprehensive implementation of frequentist conditional power for adaptive sample size re-estimation using the VALOR trial case study. The frequentist approach provides a classical, transparent framework for adaptive decision-making with several key characteristics:

## Key Methodological Features

**Strength in Transparency**: The frequentist framework requires explicit specification of effect size assumptions, making all decisions traceable and auditable. This transparency is particularly valuable in regulatory settings where clear documentation of decision rationale is essential.

**Computational Efficiency**: Direct analytical formulas enable real-time conditional power calculations without complex numerical integration, facilitating rapid decision-making during interim analyses.

**Regulatory Precedent**: Extensive regulatory experience with frequentist methods provides established pathways for approval and acceptance of adaptive modifications.

**Sensitivity Analysis Framework**: The need to specify fixed effect assumptions naturally leads to comprehensive sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios, providing robustness assessment that strengthens adaptive decisions.

## Implementation Insights from VALOR Case Study

The VALOR trial demonstration revealed several practical insights:

- **Assumption dependency**: Different effect size assumptions (Design: HR=0.75, MLE: HR≈0.85, Conservative: HR≈0.95, Clinical minimum: HR=0.85) led to different conditional power values and potentially different adaptive decisions.

- **Decision consistency**: Despite varying assumptions, the overall adaptive strategy remained coherent, with sensitivity analysis providing confidence bounds around decisions.

- **Sample size calculations**: When re-estimation was required, the frequentist approach provided clear, deterministic sample size recommendations based on specified effect assumptions.

- **Operational feasibility**: The computational simplicity and transparent assumptions facilitate implementation in real-world adaptive trial settings.

## Strategic Implementation Framework

**Primary Use Cases**: Frequentist conditional power is particularly well-suited for:
- Trials with established regulatory pathways requiring traditional statistical approaches
- Settings where computational simplicity and real-time calculations are priorities
- Situations where transparent, auditable decision-making is essential
- Adaptive designs where sensitivity analysis across assumptions is desired

**Quality Assurance**: Implementation success requires:
- Systematic pre-specification of all potential effect size assumptions
- Comprehensive sensitivity analysis across reasonable assumption ranges  
- Clear documentation of primary assumption selection rationale
- Independent verification of conditional power and sample size calculations

## Future Methodological Evolution

The frequentist conditional power framework continues to evolve with several promising directions:

**Enhanced Assumption Selection**: Development of data-driven approaches for selecting among alternative effect size assumptions based on interim data quality and clinical context.

**Regulatory Innovation**: Establishment of standardized templates and guidelines for frequentist adaptive designs to streamline regulatory review and approval.

**Hybrid Methodologies**: Integration of frequentist calculations with Bayesian interpretation or empirical Bayes effect size estimation to combine the best features of both approaches.

**Computational Integration**: Development of real-time adaptive trial platforms that seamlessly implement frequentist conditional power calculations within integrated clinical data systems.

## Concluding Perspective

The frequentist approach to conditional power represents a mature, well-validated methodology for adaptive clinical trial design. While it requires careful attention to effect size assumption selection and sensitivity analysis, it provides transparent, computationally efficient, and regulatory-acceptable pathways for adaptive modifications.

The VALOR case study demonstrates that frequentist conditional power can effectively guide sample size re-estimation decisions when properly implemented with appropriate sensitivity analysis. The key to success lies not in selecting the "correct" single assumption, but in systematically evaluating decisions across a range of plausible assumptions and ensuring robustness of adaptive strategies.

As clinical research continues to embrace adaptive methodologies, frequentist conditional power will remain a fundamental tool in the adaptive design toolkit, particularly valued for its transparency, computational efficiency, and established regulatory precedent. The approach works best when combined with careful clinical judgment and comprehensive sensitivity analysis, providing a solid foundation for evidence-based adaptive decision-making.

**This tutorial provides a complete framework for implementing frequentist conditional power in adaptive clinical trials. The VALOR case study demonstrates the methodology's practical application while highlighting the critical importance of assumption selection and sensitivity analysis in frequentist adaptive designs.**
